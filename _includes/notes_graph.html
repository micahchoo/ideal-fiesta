<!-- This script is used to create a graph visualization using the D3 library. It loads the D3 library asynchronously using a script element and calls the loadGraph function when the page finishes loading or the user scrolls.

The loadGraph function checks if the graph-wrapper element is within the viewport and if the commentFlag variable is true, and only continues if both conditions are met. It then creates a new script element and sets its src attribute to the URL of the D3 library, sets its crossOrigin and integrity attributes, and appends it to the document body. When the D3 library finishes loading, it calls an anonymous function that defines various constants and variables, including MINIMAL_NODE_SIZE, MAX_NODE_SIZE, ACTIVE_RADIUS_FACTOR, STROKE, FONT_SIZE, TICKS, FONT_BASELINE, and MAX_LABEL_LENGTH. It also sets nodesData and linksData to the nodes and edges properties of the graphData object, respectively.

The anonymous function also defines the updateNodeSize function, which calculates the size of each node based on the number of links it has, and stores it in the nodeSize object using the node's id as the key. It also defines the onClick, onMouseover, and onMouseout functions, which handle click, mouseover, and mouseout events on the graph elements, respectively. The sameNodes and sameEdges functions are used to compare the previous and next data sets to determine if the graph needs to be updated.

Finally, the anonymous function sets up the graph visualization using the D3 library, including the simulation, links, nodes, texts, and labels. It also sets up event listeners for the various elements and starts the simulation. -->

	<!-- This is a stylesheet written in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for a webpage or application. It defines the styles for various elements on the page, such as links, nodes (circle elements), and text.

The styles defined in this stylesheet include the color, cursor, fill color, transition, and opacity of various elements. For example, the links line style defines the stroke color, opacity, and cursor for the line element within a links class. The nodes circle style defines the cursor, fill color, and transition for the circle element within a nodes class.

The inactive class defines the opacity and transition for elements that are inactive. The #graph-wrapper style defines the background, border radius, and height for an element with the ID graph-wrapper.

This stylesheet is used to control the visual appearance of the elements on the page and make them more user-friendly and visually appealing. -->
