# Esteva - development

Truman introduced the idea of underdevelopment through his policy of "development" 

*"a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing"*

idea of countries being underdeveloped came through the false equation of a population's struggles against those in power and underdevelopment because now the US is a shining beacon of developed infrastructure with "freeedom"
