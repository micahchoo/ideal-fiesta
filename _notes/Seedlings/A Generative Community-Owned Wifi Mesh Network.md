# A Generative Community-Owned Wifi Mesh Network

A Generative Community-Owned Wifi Mesh Network
===

To be generative and local, the network must facilitate content creation and use of content to generate organic and local opportunities. Here is our attempt at laying down what kind of actions from which stakeholders might be encouraged, discouraged in the pursuance of a generative CoW network. 

## Who are the stakeholders

 1.Builders] - Those who add] nodes and devices to network or contribute to it

2. Maintainers] - Who work on maintaining] and debugging issues in the network
3. Consumers]

	- Who are using] the internet through the mesh and accessing]
	- Who are fulfilling] requests for gigs, services and products

1. Creators] - Those who create], collate and curate material for local content
2. Offerors] - Those who offer] gigs, service requests, product requests, (Knowledge, Processes, Tools, Connections)
3. extraMeshers] - Those who facilitate these activities from outside the mesh

## What are these actions optimising for

1. [add](/3tU6wijOQC-2NUzIy3N6vA) 
       **Incentivise**
       - Add nodes 
       - Getting Support
       
2. [maintaining](/bYFCqRP7QIOTzm50KJY_AQ) 
       **Incentivise**
       - people without the technical knowhow to become a part of the maintenance routine
       - feed into [add](/3tU6wijOQC-2NUzIy3N6vA)
       
3. [using](/0n0zT0cDTP-lqCZfffYuow) (_Using here is referring to the larger Internet_)
       **Incentivise**
       - should offer curation capabilities and incentivise it. Feed into [accessing](/me4VHZ0PQWqZwAWDM8wYVg)
       - make sharing smoother outside the local network
       **Disincentivise** 
       - fake news and rumours that spread
       - hogging of bandwidth for games, movies and other high traffic media

4. [accessing](/me4VHZ0PQWqZwAWDM8wYVg)(_local content_)
       **Incentivise**
       - accessing local content
       - curation for others
       **Feed Into**
       - [offer](/AuojkQ6XQ9iCfMnljCmqKw)

5. [offer](/AuojkQ6XQ9iCfMnljCmqKw) 
       **Incentivise**
           - local content creation
           - local jobs
           - smaller first
           - curation offers
           - collection offers
           - local enterprise creation (value additive)
       **Disincentivise**
           - eye slavery - ad watching
       **Feed Into**
           - [create](/INkpZmD9S4WJMKciD2IbEg)
           - [accessing](/me4VHZ0PQWqZwAWDM8wYVg)

In 3 categories, we describe how these interactions play Out. What is incentivised, what isn't and what feeds into what. These are the initial questions.

The important questions thereafter are

1. Should we quantify this? Why? Why not?
2. If we don't quantify this, can these incentives be imagined as something other than currency?
3. If it is currency how do we quantify it?
