# Care in Collectives

[[Capstone Dumpyard]]

 Does it need to fit into a particular domain

	* Would domainifying this lead to its remediation

	* [[Compost Thoughts]] - remdiation in context 1

	* infrastructuring as meme - remediation in context 2	

 Paul's thoughts - "The archetypes work well because they can be plugged into different communities. a maintainer in one field looks very different in another"

	* The co-authoring bit comes from archetypes of care

	* Archetypes come from the roles that people have played in collectives

	* Does this come closer to co-authoring as the only way a collective puts things out there?

		* what about the non-humans? Where do they feature

- supports and inspires mutual care for worldly conditions.
- Hannah Arendt’s notion of amor mundi, or love of the world.
- the complex, extrasubjective “web”
- when people combine together to tend not to themselves but to the world in which they live.3
- Care for the world, distinct from concern for oneself or for an Other, is an ethos uniquely fit for democratic life.1
- the world, understood as the array of material and immaterial conditions under which human beings live—both with one another and with a rich variety of nonhumans, organic and technological.
- democratic practice is irreducible to formal structures of government
