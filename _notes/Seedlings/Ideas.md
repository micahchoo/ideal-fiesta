[Social Humans Labels](https://www.docnow.io/social-humans/sh-c-labels.html)  These labels are meant to be used by content creators to indicate their wishes. If you are an archivist or academic looking to apply labels, check out [SH-A Labels](https://www.docnow.io/social-humans/sh-a-labels.html).  The labels are designed in the motif of the community garden, with visual imagery to remind us to foster our online communities by caring for the people behind the content and helping them thrive. + #CreativeCommons [[Ideas of Care]] + [TK Labels – Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/)
