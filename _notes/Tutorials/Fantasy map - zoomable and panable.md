# Fantasy map - zoomable and panable

To create a fantasy map that is zoomable, panable, and displays different illustrations at different zoom levels using Leaflet, you will need to follow these steps:

### Method 1

1. Create the base map tiles for your fantasy map. You can use a tool such as TileMill or Mapbox Studio to create custom map tiles from your fantasy map illustrations. Alternatively, you can use a static image of your map as the base layer, although this may not provide the best performance for larger maps.
    
2. Set up a web server to host your map tiles and any other assets you need for your map, such as JavaScript and CSS files. You can use a tool such as Apache or Nginx to set up the web server.
    
3. Create a HTML file for your map and include the Leaflet library and any other dependencies you need. You can use the `L.tileLayer()` function to add your base map tiles to the map, and you can use the `L.map()` function to set up the map container and the initial view of the map.
    
4. Add any other layers or features you want to display on your map. You can use the various layer and marker functions provided by Leaflet to add features such as markers, polygons, and pop-ups to your map.
    
5. Use the `map.on()` function to listen for map events, such as zoom or pan, and update the map accordingly. For example, you can use the `zoomend` event to trigger a function that updates the map tiles or other layers based on the current zoom level.

### Method 2

1. Create the base map for your fantasy world. You can use a tool such as GIMP or Photoshop to create a base map of your fantasy world, with different illustrations for different features such as land, water, mountains, forests, etc. You may want to create a separate layer for each feature, so that you can turn them on and off as needed.
    
2. Create different versions of the map at different zoom levels. You will need to create multiple versions of the map at different resolutions, with more detail at higher zoom levels. You can use the same tool as for the base map to create these versions, or you can use a specialized tool such as the MapTiler.
    
3. Host the map tiles on a web server. You will need to host the map tiles on a web server so that they can be accessed by the Leaflet map. You can use a tool such as the MapTiler to generate the tiles and an HTML viewer, or you can use a standalone web server such as Apache or Nginx to serve the tiles.
    
4. Set up the Leaflet map. You can use the Leaflet API to create a map and add the map tiles to the map using the `L.tileLayer()` function. You can specify different URL patterns for the tiles at different zoom levels using the `zoomlevels` option. You can also use the `maxNativeZoom` and `maxZoom` options to control the maximum
