# self-hosted version of google photos

## i want to set up a self-hosted version of google photos with image embeds to external websites, management of metadata and tagging

It is possible to set up a self-hosted version of Google Photos with the ability to embed images on external websites and manage metadata and tagging. One way to do this is to use an open source software package called Lychee.

Lychee is a web-based photo management application that allows you to upload, organize, and share your photos. It has a number of features that are similar to those of Google Photos, including support for metadata and tagging, the ability to embed images on external websites, and a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

To set up Lychee, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install a web server and a database server on your server. Lychee requires a web server (such as Apache or Nginx) and a database server (such as MySQL or MariaDB) to run. You will need to install and configure these servers before you can install Lychee.
    
2. Download and extract the Lychee release package. You can find the latest release of Lychee on the project's GitHub page. Once you have downloaded the package, extract it to a directory on your server.
    
3. Create a database for Lychee. You will need to create a new database and user account for Lychee to use. You can do this using the command line or a graphical tool such as phpMyAdmin.
    
4. Configure Lychee. You will need to edit the configuration file (`config.php`) to specify the location of the database and other settings. You can find detailed instructions in the Lychee documentation.
    
5. Install Lychee. Once you have completed the configuration, you can install Lychee by accessing the installation URL in your web browser. This will guide you through the installation process and set up the database tables and initial user account.
    

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## there are already many images on my server, how will it ingest them

If you already have a large number of images on your server and you want to use Lychee to manage them, you can import the images into Lychee using the bulk upload feature. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Set up Lychee and create a database as described in the previous answer.
    
2. Create a directory on your server where you want to store your images. This can be anywhere on your server, but it should be accessible to the web server.
    
3. Upload your images to the directory you created. You can use a tool such as scp, rsync, or FTP to transfer the images from your local machine to the server.
    
4. Open Lychee in your web browser and log in as the administrator.
    
5. Click on the "Import" button in the top menu.
    
6. Select the directory containing your images and click "Start Import".
    

Lychee will then scan the directory and import all the images it finds into the database. This process may take some time depending on the number and size of your images.

Once the import is complete, you will be able to view, organize, and share your images using Lychee.

## suppose i need to serve an image from lychee to an external website, like a blog

If you want to serve an image from Lychee on an external website, such as a blog, you can use the embed feature to generate an embed code for the image. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Lychee in your web browser and log in.
    
2. Navigate to the image you want to embed.
    
3. Click on the "Share" button in the top menu.
    
4. Click on the "Embed" tab.
    
5. Select the size and style of the embed code. You can choose from several predefined sizes or enter a custom size. You can also choose whether to include a caption and a link to the original image.
    
6. Copy the embed code to your clipboard.
    
7. Paste the embed code into the HTML of your website or blog post.
    

When you view the page on your website, the image will be displayed within an iframe, and users will be able to interact with it using the Lychee viewer.
