# Bose and Food in India

additional context: this project imagines that subhashchandra bose never died and fought the british with the help of the japanese. He then fought theAmericans and Japanese who divided control over north west and north east [india+pakistan]. in the following years of nation-building, he was forced to focus the nation's resources on food productions because of the repeated famines between 1940 to 1960s. a radical breakthrough came from nuclear science that found isotopes that radically improved food yield. Following which the nation invested in an internet that is very different to the one that we have now. it was built to facilitate food production and transportation in a peer to peer way. with this household method of food production, the food production worked like a decentralised power grid. higher producing parts step up to meet the demand in lower producing parts without a middleman, entirely facilitated by the p2p Antarsam internet. Paul (a times traveller is like a traveller who travels between possibilities rather than time) is the main protagonist. They are commenting on the differences between the last universe they visited(ours, where you and i exist) and this one. how radically different the politics are.

Welcome to the Antarsam Community Meeting.  We have with us our beloved Netaji. Let us Namaskaar to our Freedomgiver before we begin. 

Also I would like to welcome another special guest, Paul Anthony George. He is a times traveller coming to us from an alternate dimension. What year is it in your timeline Paul?

Oh, here if we take the Gregorian calendar which we don't, it is either late 2006 or early 2007. Anyway we can discuss this later. Paul comes from a timeline where our struggle for Independence would be won peacefully. But we would remain as puppets of those capitalist pigs. Thank your luck when you go home. 

Anyway, we are here today to discuss a system that fits into our Antarsamcalled Internet in your timeline Paul. We have tried to make food distribution at decentralized as possible. 

However, A huge proportion of waste is generated in the process of production and transport. This is despite our highly awarded and efficient public goods and people transport system. This problem has been made worse by the rebel attacks on our Central farms.  That's where we met Paul, he suggested what we were already thinking. 

The Decentralization of Production

This particular system aims to involve the women in the process of building our nation. Till now they looked after their families but the nation is their family and being mothers your role would come easily to them. 

Now our committee has come up with two interventions that will change the game. 

Intervention 1

Is from the new and improved field of genetics. We have created a house plant that can when mixed with the right ingredients create a perfect nutritional mix. We estimate that having just three in a house is enough to create 200 kilos of liquid food every week for a month. The time the plant takes to regrow is one month. So every community can have alternate roles of producers and transporters that interchange roles every month. This should create local revenue and create much faster pathways for food to flow. The scientists call it Mrutaru or Nectar. 

The next intervention is the machine we need to make this into liquid food. This we call the annacharkha. It is a machine thanks connects to the cycles we mandatorily installed in every house in the third second and first tiered cities. It converts the mix into liquid food just through the act of cycling. This can also help in the rising problem of urban female obesity. 

Further, research is being done to create food options just through the addition of simple tablets that can create different nutritional sets of food and tastes. They unleash harmless bacteria that edit the Mrutaru's Genes in a specific way. 

We would like to call this entire system 'Langaar'. And the inclusion of women into the labor force will improve our production 5 times in the next 2 years at least. 

Thank you. Any questions?

Panel 1: Introduction to the Antarsam Community Meeting, including the presence of Netaji, a leader in the fight for independence, and Paul Anthony George, a times traveler from an alternate dimension.

Panel 2: Overview of the Langaar system, a decentralized food production and distribution system that involves women in the labor force. Description of the challenges faced by the community in terms of waste generated in food production and transportation, particularly following rebel attacks on central farms.

Panel 3: Introduction to the first intervention of the Langaar system, genetically modified house plants called Mrutaru or Nectar, which can produce a nutritional mix when mixed with certain ingredients. Explanation of how these plants can be grown and harvested by community members on a rotating basis, creating local revenue and more efficient pathways for food to flow.

Panel 4: Description of the annacharkha machine, which converts the nutritional mix into liquid food through the energy of cycling. Mention of the potential benefits of this machine in addressing urban female obesity.

Panel 5: Overview of ongoing research on the use of tablets to create different types of food through the editing of the genes of the modified plants.

Panel 6: Conclusion of the Langaar project and its potential to improve production efficiency, challenge traditional systems of food distribution, empower women, and raise important ethical and political questions.

Panel 7: Reflections from Paul, the times traveler, on the differences between their previous universe and the Antarsam community, including the radical politics and focus on food production and distribution.
