DESCRIPTION

This collection is an archive of media (videos, documents, presentations, graphics, etc.) that were created by the DWeb community, in the context of DWeb-related activities.

Decentralized Web (DWeb) is an initiative to facilitate discussions, thinking, and action to build a more private, reliable, secure, and open web. Since 2016, DWeb has been building bridges to enable diverse communities to freely exchange ideas about the technologies, values, markets and agreements we need to move forward.

To date (Summer 2021) DWeb has grown to include nine “nodes” across four continents. In addition to monthly DWeb meetups, we produce DWeb Camp and the Decentralized Web Summit. Our community has developed a set of DWeb Principles to help guide the technological development of a decentralized web.
