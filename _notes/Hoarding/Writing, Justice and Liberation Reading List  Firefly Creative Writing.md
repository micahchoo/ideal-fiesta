## Decolonizing the Writing World

## A primer of things to read and watch.

## Thank you for joining us here.

In the last few years, there has been an upswell of dialogue in the writing community about how racism, colonialism, and other oppressive power dynamics operate in creative writing spaces. Brilliant writers and educators like [Felicia Rose Chavez](https://www.antiracistworkshop.com/), [David Mura](http://www.davidmura.com/), [Matthew Salesses](https://matthewsalesses.com/), and the folks at [Writing The Other](https://writingtheother.com/) have been at the forefront of this conversation.

For us this conversation is not only exciting but crucial. We’re following closely, reading widely, exploring how to keep decolonizing our space and our practices. We believe in breaking down the canon, throwing out the rules, and deeply questioning the unconscious beliefs we all bring into creative writing conversations. This is the way forward for the writing world that we want to be part of.

Below are some of the articles, books, and lectures that have influenced Firefly’s thinking. This list is by no means exhaustive. We’ve chosen to centre BIPOC writers and websites without paywalls.

Here’s to brave spaces, deep dialogue, and continued growth for the writing community, inside and outside of our walls.
